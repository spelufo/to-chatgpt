## To ChatGPT

A browser extension to quickly experiment with GPT prompts.

### Features

- [ ] Define custom prompt templates through the extension's UI.
- [x] Add prompt templates to the browser's context menu to make different kinds
  of queries. When clicked the browser selection is spliced into the template to
  build a prompt that is passed to ChatGPT, which opens in a new browser tab.


### Ideas for future work

- We may want to make a single abstraction for remote controlling the ChatGPT UI,
  such that the same API can be used from a browser extension or a pupeteer script.
